2. Android Studio will start building the APK for you. Once done, a pop-up on the bottom right of studio will notify you of its completion. Click the ‘locate’ button in this dialog.

3. The ‘locate’ button should open File Explorer with the debug folder open that contains a file called “app-debug.apk”.

4. That’s it. Rename this file and share!
